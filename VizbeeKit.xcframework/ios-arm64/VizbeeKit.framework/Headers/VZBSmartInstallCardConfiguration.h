/**
* Configuration class for customizing the Smart Install card UI.
*
* This class extends VZBCardConfiguration to provide specific customization
* options for the card that guides users through the app installation process.
* It inherits all basic customization properties (title, subtitle, ctaText)
* from its parent class.
*
* Use this configuration when you want to customize the appearance of the card
* that promotes app installation on the target device for an enhanced viewing
* experience.
*
* @note It is recommended to use cloud configuration instead of API customization
* for card content. API customization should only be used for specific use cases
* that require dynamic content. Cloud configuration provides more flexibility and
* doesn't require app updates for content changes.
*
* @note Important: When providing configuration through the API, all properties must be filled.
* Mixing values between API and cloud configuration is not supported, especially for primitive types.
* This ensures consistency and prevents unexpected behavior when retrieving values.
*
* Example usage:
* ```
* VZBSmartInstallCardConfiguration *config = [[VZBSmartInstallCardConfiguration alloc] init];
* config.title = @"Install on TV";
* config.subtitle = @"Install <app_name> app on your <screen_device_type> for the best viewing experiences";
* config.ctaText = @"Install Now";
* ```
